It has Alexa, takes and makes calls, keeps track of your heart rate, your steps, blood oxygen, detects stress, etcâ€¦ I love it for its health tracking and that you can make calls is an added bonus. Thereâ€™s no way I would pay top dollar for a name brand when this watch does the exact same thing. Andâ€¦ there are so many face plates to choose from.",

To date they have preformed well, there are a few minor items that I do not think are as good as the old Waze or could be improved on. 1.0 In general they do hold a charge for a week. 3.0 While messages show up on screen they do not stay on long enough to see and I cannot find a way to scan or see them without going back to iPhone. 4.0 May be something I am doing but the watches do not seem to sync time changes with app unless you open the app on the phone, this created some confusiion on a cruise as to what time it really was. 5.0 Would be nice to have selection of alarm sounds other than the strange sound that comes out of the watch and a volume controls for the alarm (one you can test with set).",

If I turn it off then back on it works great but the next time I tested it, again no sound. Minor issue for me but it might make a difference for someone else. Oh, also love the sleep function to track not just hours of sleep but deep sleep, rem, and light sleep. Great product for a great price!",

Its high-capacity battery enables extended usage, complemented by rapid charging capabilities even faster if you have a 45W charger. Preliminary assessments indicate highly favorable performance. Acquisition of this device is strongly advised. The phone's robust design incorporates a metal frame, a departure from prior models, while maintaining an ergonomic profile. Its dimensions are comparable to the S23 Ultra, although featuring more rounded edges. Considering its size, storage capacity, operating system, battery life, and photographic capabilities, it presents exceptional value. This device is highly recommended.",

Durability so far is great, but I instantly put on camera covers, screen protectors, and a case. Gotta baby smartphones or you will regret it long term. The plus is the perfect size for me. I wish I had gotten the ultra only for the cameras, but in my opinion the price difference is not worth it. Takes really amazing photos even though I am only reviewing the s25+.",

The data transfer goes very smoothly and the phone leads you through the steps easily. But here is what they do not tell you: the data transfer does not transfer anything you have paired and it does not transfer logons and passwords for all of the Apps transferred. There is still a massive amount of work to do to get to the smooth operation of your previous phone. Battery life is definitely better with this phone. I am pleased with the purchase.",

NOT anymore!! I bought this new Samsung and upon charging it literally walked me through Step-by-Step on how to transfer my phone data, contacts, apps, etc...and keeping my phone number. I also received $200.00 from Amazon!! So getting the best phone on the market at a great deal!! I am not tech savvy AT ALL, so was so proud that I took this small leap of faith to do it myself (it was one of the easiest tech things I have ever done) and saved several hundred dollars by doing so!! Love this phone! The Camera takes excellent pictures and videos and the features are great! Love also that I got back $200.00 Amazon gift card!!",

Please consider a camera update that allows for full manual adjustments, utilizing all the capabilities of the hardware. Currently, there are limits in place. For example, in astrophotos using the raw camera, the ISO can only be manually adjusted up to 3200, while AI allows it to go up to 8000. Although editing is possible afterward, I would prefer to set the camera for an optimal professional photo according to my preferences and the hardware's capabilities. Offering both options—AI & auto, and a fully manual mode without limits—would be fantastic. If anyone has been able to make all adjustments manually, please share your experience.",

And movement registered by the palm, caused the phone to cancel out your actual taps. So like Steve said a decade ago…”you’re holding it wrong” or it just sucks.\n\nScreen is vivid… but as always blow out many of the photos and videos you view on screen….something to keep in mind as your photos will look differently on a computer or on an iPhone.\n\nMost annoying - WiFi drops suddenly or when not in use for a bit. Usually it’ll reconnect in a second on my iPhone…takes over a minute on the s25. Very annoying when low cell coverage.\n\nAnd worst of all…why buy at this price if next week Amazon will discount this for 100 dollars ? Not going to get hit with the lower price 31 days later…",

Many like the boxy look of the 24 ultra but i don't have any issues.\n\nSo far my only complaint is the removal of Bluetooth for s pen and software update.\nIt is an utterly poor excuse from Samsung for removing that feature even though they claim less than 1 percent uses it.\nJust because i do not use my spare tire on my car regularly does not mean i do not want it on my vehicle. When i do need it i am happy that its there when i need it. Sammy should fix this ASAP\n\nAs for software......it is February and the phone is still on December patch.....\n\nOverall though....great device",

I wasn't going to do that, but my phone got the vertical stripe, and I didn't want to invest more into it, so...\nAll these years I have lamented the quality of my photos from the S20+. Sure, with a casual glance, they're fine. But zooming in, or telephoto shots, and the pixelation is so bad.\nI've pick this phone (25 Ultra) with the hope of far better pics. I'm still checking that out, but what I like right off the bat, is the \"Remaster\". This AI rework on my past photos is great (not perfect, of course, but sure helps in some instances).\nI'm trying out the AI voice interaction, and it's growing on me a little. Probably not worth the cost to buy, but I picked this hopefully to have better pics.\nAdded 3/3/25: I've been taking pictures and finding that this Ultra does a much better job. See photos: the first is normal (wide-angle 23mm), the 2nd is 10x telephoto. Much better than my old S20+.",

I only have one gripe, and once Samsung fixes it I'll come back and change my review to five stars... It's no longer possible to have a 4x5 grid pattern on the home screens. The only options now are 4x6 or 5x6. I read in one forum that eventually it will be possible? I'm hoping that's the case. I thought the phone was going to be better in every regard but this particular limitation is a step down for me. Anyway great phone overall!\nUpdate: I've been using this phone for 5 days now and screw it, I'm moving my review to five stars even though I still can't do the 4x5 grid. This phone is amazing.\n2nd update: Not really an update, just that I forgot to mention how easy it is to transition from one Samsung to another. Literally all my apps on the other phone were downloaded to the new phone, it was so freaking easy to make the transition.",

First of all, it comes with a good bit of crapware installed. A handful of Microsoft apps are there (which you can thankfully permanently remove). There's a ton of Samsung apps which you can unfortunately not remove. I don't need nor want Samsungs Browser, or their health apps, or most of the other Samsung branded apps that come preloaded on this phone that you can't remove.\n\nOne UI 7 isn't terrible, but you'll probably be better served by another launcher. At least you can switch that.\n\nOverall, I think the Pixel 9 series phones offer a more cohesive software experience. The only way I'd opt for this over them is if you have used and like Samsungs phones and apps, and want a phone for gaming (for which the Snapdragon X Elite chip is better for than the Tensor G4 in the Pixels).",

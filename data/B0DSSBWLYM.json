The case is a thick, hard-to-cut plastic. I cut some out for the microSD card so it can be removed. A USB-C thumb drive can be used as well.\n\nKeyboard is thin and rechargeable.

That being said, this is a dynamic little generic Android tablet for the money. I was bored with my Fire HD from 2021 which was slow to open up pretty much any app, and this Android 14 tablet was so much faster. Youtube TV, Chrome, etc. all booted up quick and was plenty responsive. The brightness is also fantastic, I had to turn it way down for most uses so that's not an issue. The screen isn't the highest resolution but it's \"serviceable\" but you get what you pay for, and then some, with the price point of this. The company even packed in a mouse and keyboard -- what's not to love? I can see this being a real overperformer on Black Friday or similar holidays if it goes on sale. For the money it's a great option.",

The battery life is solid, lasting through movies and music without completely draining.\n\nThe case feels sturdy and provides good protection, which is a plus. I also appreciate the included keyboard; it adds a nice bit of value and makes it easier to type out emails or documents. It connects easily to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which is nice for streaming or using it with other devices. The cameras are okay too; they do the job for video calls or quick snaps. They suffice for being from a tablet camera, but even my phone takes a better picture. Overall, this is a good tablet for everyday use, but it could definitely use a better display. At its current price point, this is a fair bargain that could be gifted this upcoming holiday season!",

I like that it is Android OS 14, I hope that it will continue to receive updates for a long time. Battery life is decent, I have another one with a 10,000 mAh battery with the same specs that does last longer. This is good for about an 8 hour binge session of watching videos.",

I never want to carry around expensive electronics and this tablet is in a good enough price range that I wouldn't be completely torn if if I lost it or if it broke. The overall performance of this for an Android tablet is great, especially when you think of where it's priced at.\n\nHaving the keyboard and mouse come with it is a great addition so you can have it act as a laptop for writing documents or doing some lightweight work on it when you're on the go.",

            "review-body": "I have had Blu phones for the past 15 yrs. and I'm coming from the Blu G91s which is 3 yrs. old and still works fine but I wanted to upgrade to Android 14. OS upgrades in Blu phones are non-existent. This is the best yet. Stunning amoled display and all the bells and whistles you would get on the big boys.\nPROS: Beautiful amoled screen with edge to edge display, 60-120hz. refresh rate that is customizable. Bright enough to see on sunny day. Very light weight, my purse fells so much lighter now. Very snappy, fast. Charges 20-100% in 40 minutes. Lots of customization settings, but this is probably Android 14 features. Phone calls are very clear sounding.\nCONS: Transfering date from old phone does not work well using wired connection. Use bluetooth connection for transfering data and this is completed very quickly. Speakers are good for regular use, but would not listen to music on them. SIM tray is funky and hard to open. It did lose connection when I first installed SIM, but is ok after re-installing. Blu does not have OS updates at all, but does have security updates. Camera is ok, not stunning, but does have all the settings you would get on the expensive phones. No RAW, no image stabalization. Macro is useless. See attached photos. Phone came with a ton of bloatware, and an entire tray of games which can be erased. The large camera circle on back of phone is a bit concerning for scraching, etc. What were they thinking? Phone did get warm, not hot on initial charging, but now is not a problem at all.\nSo far I am thrilled with my new phone, and highly recommend for someone who doesn't want to spend top dollar but still get top perfermance and features.",

            "review-body": "So first off I was skeptical of the price and what was coming with that price. Well long story short I couldn't be happier with this phone after one week of use. Beautiful big display, it feels very expensive, very high quality, it's fast, plays any game with ease, internet surfing is blazing fast. The camera for me is awesome, I'm not a camera freak but I do like a nice camera on my phone, for me this camera is way better than my last phone which broke, a razor+ 2024, that phone was decent but so far this phone is better in my mind. I've always had high end phones, this phone being $200 to me it's still high end, looks high end, feels high end and performs high end. The huge circle camera glass on the back scares me, I need a protector yesterday, as well as for the front, this phone feels like something you really want to protect, the case it came with is clear and I kinda like it, wish it came with a screen protector however. Anyway if I change my mind on how I feel about this phone I will update my review asap. Don't worry about this $200 price tag, this phone has it all, at least it does in my book... So far I highly recommend this BLU K50 BOLD.\nI wasn't expecting this much of a phone for the price, theres no reason why this phone isn't triple or quadruple the price?. I will update review if I feel differently asap...",

            "review-body": "This is for the k50 from Blu, I have owned, or should I stay still on five or six blu phones, not because they stopped working, just because they're so affordable to upgrade. The cost of a blu phone is equivalent to your deductible on a higher end phone with warranty if the glass were to break. I have never had any issues with my BLU phones, if there's one thing that has happened that has made me go with the new phone, it was the battery started draining too quickly for my needs, that was after a year and a half of owning the phone. The only reason I upgraded to this K50 was because my old blu phone had Android 11 and was not being updated, this phone comes with Android 14, hopefully it will get one update as most Blu phones do. Not the phones issue, but I'm not a fan of Android 14 in the short time that I've had it, they say there was improvements, I say they just added more junk, couldn't leave well enough alone. The one disappointing part of this phone that almost all my other Blu phones have, is this does not have gorilla Glass. There is already three scratches in my screen and I've had this less than a month. My other blue phones, I do not have any scratches in the screen, and I am not one that cares about what's in my pocket with my phone, now I'll have to be cautious of what's in a pocket with this phone. That is a huge disappointment. I am not a fan of beveled screens, but I purchased a protective case that's edges sit just above the beveled screen, so no more accidentally hitting keys or items close to the edge of the screen. The screen is bright, brighter than most of the blu phones I've owned, it can be used in the Sun, it could be brighter however, where some of the blue phones have a hard time when the Sun is shining bright, that could be due to the gorilla Glass, and I'd rather have gorilla Glass and have to struggle to see my screen then be able to see my screen with scratches in it, just saying. As always the speaker on this phone is decent enough unless you're looking to jam out. The camera like all other blu phones is just okay, it's nice, it functions, but if you want to really really good camera you're going to spend $800 or more on the phone. I was a little disappointed in the extra apps that come on this phone, the one thing I always really enjoyed about the blu phones, was that it didn't come with the whole lot of apps pre-installed, very little in fact, this however came with seven or eight more than I'm used to, I don't know if that's an Android thing or blu looking to make money, either way it's not a deal breaker. This battery life does not seem as strong or as long-lasting as my other blu phones when new. As long as the battery stays strong for a year, there shouldn't be any issues, it lasts just long enough to make it the whole day for me. Set up is easy enough, it having Android 14 it's compatibility is fine. And it's connectivity is how it should be.\nI think if blue were to make a perfect phone they would really have to concentrate on the camera, really concentrate on the screen brightness outdoors and still having gorilla Glass, and work on their speakers if they can. If they addressed all that stuff even a notch or two I would pay over $200 for one of their phones.\nI highly recommend any blu phone, I've never Had an issue with them and as I said, I own six that all Still work just fine (over the course of 5 or 6 years)\nProduct arrived on time and packaged well. One more afterthought, all my BLU phones have always come with fantastic protective cases free in the box, this k50, came with a clear plastic cover, come on blu.\nRepeating myself, I am a huge fan of blu. For the money, they work, if it breaks in a year, you just replace it, it's outdated in a year, you just replace it, they're that affordable, why spend $1,000 on a phone, that you'll want to replace in a year anyways... I've never understood that.",

Finger print scanner and facial nonrecognition worked as expected.\n\nThe only problem I had with the phone was the battery drain too fast. I would charge it to 80%, and with the airplane mode on, the next morning it was down to 27%.\n\n3/30/25 update - I discovered the Libra 3 app was very draining in the background. So I closed it right after using it. This has dramatically improved battery usage. So now the battery drain overnight is about 15% point. I'd say this is borderline OK, but definitely not going to last 3 days. Realistically, I'd be happy with a 1.5 day use w/o charging.",

            "review-body": "I'm coming from a Blu G91 Pro which is a really good phone , but holy cow I wasn't expecting such a big leap in performance/ quality and how fast things could be . The face ID works almost too good because it's crazy fast and man the under the glass finger print sensor is equally impressive. This phone also has features my other phone just didn't have, like more camera features , more ram expansion and more things you can change or do. Also this phone is way brighter and with its 120Hz display which makes moving around very snappy. If your wondering about the display it's very crisp and I come from a phone that was 4g , but now with 5g I can run shows at a much higher resolution, 1080 no problem, even 4K no problem. Oh and if you like customization with your camera, well Blu has you covered, because all you gotta do is go into your camera pull down your settings and go into custom or you just have it where you can go with just more at the end with Pro features, Dual view video, macro ,group , slow motion, time lapse , AI and much more . Overall for $200 I can't imagine getting anything better , because you not only get a phone but a case , quick charge power brick and a cable . If that's not enough it has an edge display with edge lighting and a light on the back that can also do different things . I guess someone was saying this doesn't have a RAW mode , it does just go into Pro Mode and pull down from the top where you'll find extra features. Also Blu has great customer service and it blows my mind that people will complain without even trying to understand or do any kind of problem solving. So call Blu if you have a problem, like the guy who says his phone is too loud , but he just complains and complains never realizing it could be defective or something else . Maybe ask if that's normal , call Blu , do some research , because at the end of the day this is a $200 phone , not $1000 or $800 or even $500 , yet people will expect perfection and complain why it's not exactly like a $1299 Samsung phone . Oh and the person who left a one star and said Amazon/Blu said it's not their problem is BS , because I've never not once in all the years of using blu phones have I ever not had a great customer experience and they will replace your phone if you make sure and let them know it's unusable, not Amazon, Blu .",

            "review-body": "The media could not be loaded.\nI'm never buying another phone from this company ever again. The startup/shutdown sound is loud enough to wake up the whole neighborhood. The volume control sucks! The minimum is set to 14%, which is as loud as 80% on a normal phone.\n\nIn order to listen to music I had to install an app with a precise volume control and set the volume to 5% (which is impossible to do without an app), whereas on a normal phone I'd have my volume set to 40% during the day, and 10% at night. I haven't yet tried the volume at night, but I hope 1% won't wake up the dead.\n\nThis smartphone is complete embarrassment when it comes to watching movies or listening to music, unless you're deaf.\n\nP.S. It's even worse with headphones. When I use them at 14% volume, it feels like a bomb exploding into my ears.\n\nUPDATE:\nThis phone is an even worse nightmare than I thought. In order to disable the noisy system sounds I have to keep it on mute, but this also disables my phone ringtone, which means I CANNOT hear when someone is calling me!!! Isn't it common sense to separate toggles between useless system sounds and phone ringtone? I guess common sense isn't so common in some companies.\n\nAnd 1% is still too loud for watching/listening to anything at night. I'd be returning this piece of crap as soon as I get another smartphone in my mailbox.",

            "review-body": "Not my first BLU phone but my first Bold, not a bad option considering whats currently available. My last phone was a BLU F91 5G, which if it was still available I would have just bought another. I can't reconcile mentally why there is no wireless charging. Seriously, all the reasonably priced options don't have it any longer. The only reason I \"upgraded\" was because the battery in my old phone got hot enough to off gas and blow the back of the case off on my old phone so I did not have a ton of time to wait around looking for a new phone.\n\nI have been using this phone for a week and here are all the things I have noticed so far.\n\n1. It does have a dual sim card slot, but an odd one. Its on the bottom of the phone, and very difficult to get out even with the tool they provided, it took a bit of a hook to get it out. Its thicker than usual and the sim card kind of snaps in, because its double sided. You put one card facing out on the top and bottom, new to me after having dozens of phones. Nowhere could I find if it was dual sim in the documentation (Sim1 is on top).\n\n2. Its big enough storage to justify not having an SD card slot. I know nobody is doing it these days, but I have had more phones die than SD cards and a good waterproof SD card can save the day if you have a whole trips worth of pictures on the phone when you dunk it hard enough to kill the phone. But, with 256GB its got enough storage for all my MP3's and lots of pictures (I travel a lot and am on the water often where I have no service but want to be able to have music on board) plus all my apps. There was a bunch of unnecessary bloatware but not terrible and it was easy to clean up. I am at 41% used before I start taking pictures so its a bit dicey for long term usage.\n\n3. The onboard storage is slow. Unbearably slow. Transferring my files from my Windows or Unix PC was maddeningly slow, regardless of USB cable or which port I used. These are the same devices and cables I use for my old phone as well as an even older BLU G91 Pro and they are both 100 times faster to copy files over USB either to the SD card or the internal storage. It was so slow and unusable that I had to try multiple cables and ports before giving up on moving my MP3's over by USB and installing an FTP client on my phone. That was the only way I could move anything more than a few small files on or off the phone. Its something that I can overcome but its maddening.\n\n4. It came with a screen protector on it. Its good because there are not a lot of options yet, but I didn't see that anywhere.\n\n5. The case it comes with is laughable and there are not many options currently and you never know if there ever will be. Honestly for this to be in the Bold line and not have a better case than this is a bit odd. My last 2 phones had the black lightly armored cases that were good enough not to need an upgrade, this one is going back a few years and its a throw away if you can find something better. The first one I have tried doesn't even come close to having the right openings for this phone even if it fits the general form factor and camera lens so if you need a decent case maybe this is not the right phone for you.\n\n6. The fingerprint scanner is adequate but not great. Its in the screen which is the new hottness, but it doesn't work as well as my last several low end phones. I have 7 or 8 fingerprints registered to try and help my two fingers work but I have to hold it just right to get it to unlock. It works and I am getting used to it but the back panel and power button scanners both work better for me.\n\n7. Battery life is fantastic and it charges well. It does take a bit more power to do a fast charge but it is very fast and the battery easily lasts me all day. No complaints at all, other than damn I wish it had wireless charging, I mean its 2024 and many, many cars have wireless charging and it would be great to be able to use it. I know it adds heat and I wouldn't really use it in the summer and its not that fast but if you are driving its nice to just keep it topped off if you don't want to deal with wires.\n\n8. The screen is just lovely. I really should have lead with this. its the nicest looking screen I have every used, and its very bright and very clear. It is so easy to read I might be in the market for a second one because my wife's phone screen is terrible compared to this one.\n\n9. Its fast enough most of the time. Fastest phone I have ever had, very responsive nearly all the time. The ram is plenty for an old dude who has way to much open and way to many notifications all the time. The only thing slow so far is the camera, and I wonder if its because the storage is slow. That sucks for me, I have missed several candid shots already and experience has told me this is as fast as the phone will get. I am going to have to slow down myself and see if lowering the resolution will help but as of now the shutter speed is slow enough I have taken several pictures of my feet. I have only taken few a dozen pictures and a couple videos, and while they look really really good on the screen I haven't tried them on a big screen yet. The camera would also benefit from some form of stabilization but it works well enough for the price point from a quality standpoint.\n\nOverall its a good phone, I wish it had a decent case, and faster camera and storage. It wouldn't hurt to have an SD card slot. It still sucks to not have wireless charging. I hope BLU brings that one back. Its a great phone to look at and feels good in my hand and for the price its very good.",

I've been using the Moto Stylus 2024 since launch and I put it down to try this jem out. Unboxing reveled the device, clear case, wired usb-c ear buds, charger & cable, sim tool, literature and a sticker. The phone in an easy on eyes (minding the Large camera bump) purple and feels good in hand. The Large curved screen has good reachability (for larger hands) with a preinstalled screen protector. The phone did get very warm during the Initial bootup and data transfer. No worries though as the process went quickly and flawlessly. I'm using T-Mobile and getting very strong 5G UC connection with great up/down speeds. Call quality and earpiece are good although using the speakerphone isn't the best do to the lackluster single bottom firing speaker. Concerning the main speaker, it's sufficient for notifications and tones, but music and voice imo gets a thumbs down. There's no traditional headphone jack, instead it's incorporated into the charge port. I haven't tested the included Apple esq buds as I've paired my Galaxy buds2. Android auto works as expected and Bluetooth connectivity is fast using my UConnect system. Ive also paired up to my Wyze watch 47c with no issues. A few other notable likes are: Breathable light (rear notification reminder) Side swipe sidebar for apps (similar to Samsung)\nFront and rear camera and video quality minus the zoom and video EIS. Fast In screen fingerprint reader\n256 GB onboard storage despite the lack of SD support.\nI uninstalled and disabled all of the bloatware and offers which there wasn't that many of. Battery life is exceptional under normal usage and I was able to get from 20 - 100% charge in 45min using the included brick. I'm not a mobile gamer but I did test Steam link and was able to play Starfield, Fallout 4 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 1080 with no issues including heating.\nThere is an initial general software for August 2024 security update, it's unclear to me how many software and or security updates will be released for this device. A few cons: The curved screen can allow for unwanted gestures, screen brightness in sunny conditions, no tap to wake screen, although has lift to wake. No SD card support, no stereo speakers and a bad quality primary speaker. Included case will yellow and is flimsy so an aftermarket case is advised.\nAside from a few beef's I can easily recommend this an everyday device.",

No interrupt when watching YouTube.\nFast charging time(less than 2 hours for a full charge), can use at least 1 day for watching YouTube.\nBLU phones always come with every things in the box, but this time no screen protector, maybe because the curve edge?\nThe plastic case is banded at the lower volume bottom(see picture) that would cause the problem to press the lower volume button(need to press couple times to make a screenshot).\nThis phone is not a wireless charging phone.\nOverall this is a good phone so far.\nI am a loyalty customer of BLU, all the BLU phones I used before DIED because the USB socket was not functioning and couldn't be charged. I am trying not to use the phone when charging in the future and I hope I can use it longer.\nAlso, I am going to order another 5G BLU phone (F5) for $99, I think it worth it!",

One item that is really weird regarding this phone, the dial push buttons numbers for making a call are only numbers (no corresponding letters). I have never seen a phone made like this where the alphabet letters are not listed with the corresponding numbers for dialing or entering a pass code. Basically if you need to input any pass-codes on this phone when you are calling someone (opening your phone without using fingerprint or facial recognition but a pass code), and you need to press the phone button numbers, you better remember what letters correspond with each number as this phone doesn't show the corresponding letters of the alphabet and that is kind of a bummer. Why Blu would you make a phone like this? Only 3 stars because of this.",

I've had Blu phones as recently as 2020 and they did exactly what I needed them to do, and were always comparable to the Galaxy S series phones.\n\nThat being said, I was looking for a newer phone because my Galaxy S21 has a few weird glitches going on that annoy me (screen turning a green hue, a weird line across the screen) and the newest S24 is not currently in the budget.\n\nSetting up the Bold K50 today was a bad experience from start to finish. The phone feels cheap right out of the box. It's not as wide as my S21 and probably weighs half as much.\n\nThe cable wouldn't \"stay connected\" to copy over my data -- despite the cable still being physically connected. So my call history and text history didn't come over.\n\nNo big deal, right? I can find an app to do that later.\n\nThen, I was asked to download a bunch of fluffy games as part of the setup. Again, not a huge deal, I'll just say no to all of that.\n\nTHEN when I finally get into the phone, there are a bunch of apps I've never downloaded (PlutoTV, Texaco, Chevron, just to name a few) and I had to delete them all. Plus an additional page full of app \"games\" that I'd rather not just be right there on my phone without my permission.\n\nAfter that, I couldn't seem to delete a folder on the home page, no matter how hard I tried. My only options were to view it bigger or smaller, but I couldn't actually remove or delete it, even when the folder was empty.\n\nThe final straw for me was the camera. It's probably okay quality but the camera takes incredibly small photos as compared to my S21. On the S21, the photo is the whole screen. Which admittedly probably isn't a normal photo shape (like not 4x6, for example) but it's what I'm used to and what I'm now looking for.\n\nOn top of that, the K50 doesn't have a zoom *out* feature which is one I actually use quite a lot.\n\nSure, some of this could have been things to expect or that I could have read about in the specs, and maybe that means I didn't look hard enough/shouldn't have purchased this phone. My success with Blu phones in the past led me to believe this one would hold up to AT LEAST a 3 year/version old Galaxy but the S21 blows it out of the water.\n\nI started setup about an hour ago, and I've already switched back to my S21 and will be returning this phone. Hopefully the S24 goes on sale for Black Friday and I'll make a new purchase then.",

This phone did not have any SD storage but had double the internal storage (256GB) and if I need to backup, I just do it with my computer before making any massive changes... problem solved).

Aside from the fact that it doesn't have a stylus, there really isn't much difference between the two. I noticed the speed and stability of the K50s performance the minute I first booted it up. It's fast as hell. Apps download in just under two seconds, games play smoothly with no lag, and movies stream with zero buffering. The screen resolution is sharp and vibrant, the battery charges quickly and is long lasting, and it takes absolutely phenomenal photos. I think, despite the sometimes poor reputation of the company, the Bold K50 puts Blu on a straight path towards redemption.\n\nIF I had to find some sort of negative aspect about this phone, it would probably be the screen. As much as I love the infinity display and curved screen, this one is very touchy along the edges, so you have to be careful with how you hold the phone in your hand if it doesn't have a case on it (which will probably be more often than you think because the case options for this phone are INCREDIBLY limited).",

A well known malware app, Aura appservices (not to be confused with the Aura security app on Google Play), is installed and will download unwanted apps daily (from China?). There are a number of non-Google Android system apps that all start \"com.pri\" not \"com.google\" that I worry phone home to China. At least the bootloader on this phone\ncan be unlocked, which means, in theory, I should be able to root it and remove these unwanted, locked apps with adb.

The out of box life is close to 3 days on idle, and you get a solid 24 hours of use out of it otherwise, which I find very acceptable.\nStorage: 256gb out of the box is very good. The amount of space is plenty of room to download practically everything I would use on my phone without having to worry about storage space.\nRAM: 8GB of standard ram plus 16GB of Xram. As far as I understand operates as RAM more or less.\nCpu power. As far as the power of the processor goes, this is a great value for the price range. I tried playing a few games and none had any lag which is a big positive.\nPicture quality: Excellent. Even budget phones now have an excellent DPI and the colors come out bright and vibrant.\nCamera quality: Very high. I'm very happy with the picture quality. It lacks some of the zoom capabilities of higher end phones, but I can't find a phone with picture quality that matches this for the price.\n\nA couple of cons I've noticed:\nCharges slowly. Unfortunately you won't get the fast charging speed of high end phones.\nDoes not work with every carrier. Some carriers are not compatible with this phone which is a negative.\nTries to install some bloat at startup. Attempts to install games and apps you don't want and didn't ask for, this is never a welcome feature for me.\n\nThat said, I find it hard to find a better deal than the Bold K50 for the price.

When Blu first started making phones like 6-7 years ago (or at least that's when I found out about them), they already stood out being known as a budget phone company that made phones with good specs and reliability. I think I tried two phones from Blu back in the day, and even though they were not memorable experiences (at that time I was more interested in phones from LG, HTC, Sony, etc.), they did leave an impression how inexpensive their phones were. This trend continues until today, and this phone shows that $200 has come a long way, cuz their phones back then were in the $100-$200 range, but didn't have anything in the premium realm such as an AMOLED screen. The only that comes close is the A series from Samsung, but usually those are around $300.\n\nThis particular phone has a similar design language as the old S9/S10/S11 Samsung Galaxy phones, with the very slim bezels, curved sides, and pinhole camera front screen. The processor is not great, but does just enough to run most apps from the Google Play Store, and play a few games. The RAM and memory is generous though, at 8Gb and 256GB, respectively. The cameras are overall decent - pretty good during the day or in bright lighting, and a bit fuzzy in low-light. The best part is always going to be the AMOLED screen, so definitely get this if your main apps would be YouTube, Netflix, and the other various media streaming apps. For $200, and with the Blu reputation, you can't go wrong at this price range.",

The screen is SUPER impressive. Very bright and vivid colors. It's snappy and hasn't had any software issues yet. The charging was fast and the cameras all exceed expectations in a phone under $300, let alone $200. I'm not a fan of the curves screen design, but I had a galaxy s9, so I'm not unfamiliar.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this phone. It's an absolute steal at the $200 price point. I'll update this review if anything changes.\n\nI'm using this device on T-Mobile and I've had no issues with connectivity.\n\n***Two week update: Super impressed overall. I don't like the curved screen, but the battery life is amazing. The screen is amazing. The cameras are solid. I've had zero connectivity issues. The phone is fast enough for what i need it for. This phone at $199 is an absolute no brainer.",

            "review-body": "This is my first blu phone and I'm very impressed to say the least. The screen is very good it's get plenty bright it's a curved display with 120hrz. Running day to day apps like Facebook, Instagram and tiktok runs with no problem. Text messaging, switching back and forth between apps is really smooth with the 120hrz display. It's running a near stock version of android 14. There's no skin like some Redmi phones. You might experience a hiccup or two here and there but that's not a deal breaker at all. Very slim, lightweight phone that fits perfectly in my pocket with my other phone. The camera and speaker are probably the only downfall to this phone. The speaker isn't that loud and lacks base. The camera isn't to bad if you're in decent lighting and using the main 64 megapixel camera. not bad but I've definitely seen better. I'm using this phone on mint mobile. I have no problems with getting notifications text messages and RCS chats work I get 5G connectivity with speeds over 50mb per second. Overall I really like the design of this phone the software. haptic feedback is very good when typing. The screen is probably the best that you can get in this price point. I would recommend if your looking for cheep android phone that can do it all",

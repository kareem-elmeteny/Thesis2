            "review-body": "Warning! Read this first!\n\nLook for the asterisks in the text below. Read that area first before clicking on the buy button!\n\nMy iPad 9th generation has served me well for the past few years but the battery life was beginning to suffer and the screen had a few scratches from daily use.\n\nI could have had the battery replaced, but that seemed to average around $100 and that was a no-go, especially since I was offered just $90 on trade in so spending more just didn‚Äôt make sense.\n\nNow Apple wants $349 for the base 64GB unit but I‚Äôve noticed that many stores have reduced the price to $299, possibly because Apple has discontinued sales of the 9th generation and supplies are starting to dry up.\n\nSo, I jumped at the chance to get a newer version. I‚Äôve been a good boy this year and saved my money so I could afford this.\n\nI got mine in yellow since the better half has hers in pink. No confusing these two.\n\nOne thing you‚Äôll notice upon opening the box is that the overall dimensions are not much different from the earlier generation.\n\nHowever, looks can be deceiving. The screen goes from 10.2 inches to 10.9 mainly by decreasing the top bezel and by deleting the button and fat bezel at the bottom.\n\nAnd that begs the question, how do I close out apps without pressing that button?\n\nThe android way, that‚Äôs how. You slowly swipe up from the bottom of the screen to expose open apps and then close them (or choose the one you want to use).\n\nThose of you using iPhones know this procedure well.\n\nYet another question I‚Äôve been asked - where‚Äôs the fingerprint ID if the button is gone?\n\nIt‚Äôs now combined with the power button in the upper right hand corner.\n\nI‚Äôd love to tell you that setup was a snap but I‚Äôd be lying.\n\n******This iPad bricked while trying to do an update and transfer from my old iPad. Thought I had a dud.\n\nCalled Apple and they discovered this one was lacking updates from 2022 and needed to update from 16 to 17 and then to 18 before progressing. Since my old iPad was already on 18.1, it was trying to force apps and settings to a new iPad that couldn‚Äôt readily take it.\n\nMind you, Apple verified this was indeed a brand new iPad and not a refurb or customer return. It had just been sitting around in a warehouse for nearly 2 years.\n\nSo, in short, you‚Äôll have to do updates first, and then transfer from your old iPad.\n\nAnd how do you do that?\n\n* Sign in to your Apple account.\n\n* Instead of allowing transfer from your iCloud or other iPad, tell it you want to do things manually.\n\n* At that point it‚Äôll do the updates as required.\n\n* Then you reset the iPad and start over; however, once the updates are installed they stay forever. Now transferring from either the cloud or your open iPad should be a breeze. A two hour breeze.\n\nPlan on plugging it in, too. You'll suck at least 30% of your battery doing just this procedure.*****\n\nNow back to the review.\n\nOverall operations are not drastically different from what I could see; however, I don‚Äôt use my iPad for heavy duty artistic work nor do I play intense games. For Joe or Jane Everyday, this iPad won‚Äôt present any significant performance changes.\n\nHow about the screen? Looks about the same to me.\n\nBattery life? Improved over my old tablet only because that battery was on its way out, but only time will tell if it is substantially better.\n\nI will give points to Apple, though, for finally going to a USB-C charger instead of the Lightning variety. I was getting tired of lugging different chargers around.\n\nNow comes the last question - is this iPad worth the extra cost when you can still (possibly) find iPad 9s for $100 less?\n\nYes and no. Yes, if you can get this model for $299 at which point it‚Äôs just $50 more than the 9th generation, comes with a bigger screen, and uses the readily accepted USB-C charger.\n\nNo, if you have to pay full retail of $350 or so. At that point you might want to live with the Lightning charger and button at the bottom.",

I received all on 3/5/25 and immediately applied the screen protector, transferred my information from an earlier iPad, and charged everything. On 3/7/25 I read a news article that Apple was releasing new products on 3/12/25. The new iPad is listed for the very same price as this one. Amazon now has a note that ‚ÄúThere is a newer version of this item‚Ä¶released on March 12, 2025,‚Äù with a link to it. I am so sorry that I purchased this iPad even though I expect it will function just fine for years to come. Had it been half price, I would feel better about the purchase, but as it cost the same as a new would cost, it is a bit painful for me. This is the ninth iPad I have purchased, and they all functioned well for their lifespans, so I expect this one will, also. Five stars because the product is good. Had I known, though, of the new releases, I would not have purchased this iPad.",

It's was my first I-anything so it took me a while to get used to it as I'm a n android kinda person but all in all it charges fast but loses it quick while going so I just leave it plugged in while I play. Quality and graphics are surprisingly great. I wasn't expecting it to be so clear and able to keep up with the fps but it definitely does. Screen cleans way and I still have no scratches after 2 months of having it so job well done there. Now the biggest downside is because codm is such a large file any update that comes along which has happened 3 times already (sigh) I have to offload the codm app and numerous other apps just to download the update because it's unusually large at 11g. But for future reference get the 256g that's what I'm looking to do now!!!! Overall good product just need more storage. And yes I know you can buy some extra cloud storage but not for the apps itself.",

When you setup an iPad make sure you document every field you enter - Label also. If you enter an email name for the Account and you forget that email name you are close to saying goodby to the iPad, I did forget what email name I entered, and Apple Support was GREAT in helping me to process the unit like it came from the factory.\n\nRemember Amazon satisfy Apple that the unit you had purchased has been reset to factory default, if you entered an email name and forget what it is then you cannot clear that out and Apple thinks you are using the unit and if you want to return the Apple unit you can't, this means you have lost your money. Kinda simple...\n\nWell, I could not remember the email name I used, did I write it down or setup a record in my password list. I looked in all my trash cans for maybe a note, could not find anything. I use a data wallet, and it has worked but you have to keep the data - I went through my last copies of the backups for the wallet and when I got back to the DATE, I received the iPad I saw an item for iPad - I made sure I had a good paper copy, loaded the current version of wallet data and started setup of iPad again. It worked!\n\nThanks to the support people at Amazon, Apple and Best Buy (they support Apple). Maybe I will try a MAC???",

I love the new iPad, with the exception that the iPad doesn‚Äôt hold its battery charge as claimed by the manufacturer. Here are the differences I noticed between the two models, explained as best I can from a basic user‚Äôs perspective. I hope this helps someone/\n\n- There is no longer a ‚Äúhome button‚Äù on the IPad; instead, you must swipe up to get back to your home page. This is simple enough and something many of us are likely familiar with from more recent versions of the iPhone.\n- The visual screen display is slightly crisper than on my 7th generation iPad.\n- The dock is clearly shown at the bottom of the screen and is expanded to include not only the sites you visit most, but the last four sites you visited.\n- To clear apps you have opened and not closed, you can no longer press the home button twice in quick succession. You now have to swipe up gently until these apps appear in separate ‚Äúboxes.‚Äù You can then swipe them off the page one at a time to get rid of them, as you wish.\n- The iPad uses an usb-c charger that is not compatible with the usb-c charger for your iPhone or with earlier iPad chargers. The correct charger is included with the iPad.\n- The iPad charges much faster with the usb-c cable than with earlier iPad chargers.\n- The one negative issue I noted has to do with how long the iPad stays charged, especially with extended use. Apple claims it will stay charged for the full day. It does not. In fact, I‚Äôm not sure that it stays charged notably longer than my 7th generation iPad.\n- A word on storage. The base level 7th Generation iPad had 32 GB of storage, which seemed like plenty when I bought it. But as new apps took more size and I wanted to do more things, it wasn‚Äôt. On my Seventh Generation IPad, approximately half of my 32 GB storage is devoted to the iPad operating system and System Data, leaving little discretionary storage, especially when a new software update requires over 7 GB of storage. I can only see needs for data storage increasing in the future. The sole reason I‚Äôm updating my current iPad is lack of storage. I don‚Äôt want to face that problem again. If you run a fair number of apps (especially apps like Netflix, YouTube, etc.), like to download video content, play games, have an extensive number of photos, save documents, and so forth, I would give serious consider upgrading from the current base model‚Äôs 64 GB of storage to 256 GB. I‚Äôm guessing 64 GB may soon be insufficient, too.\n\nThis point isn‚Äôt an iPad comparison, but a note on the technology the iPad supports. This iPad requires the 1st generation IPad pencil, not the 2nd, which was a surprise to me, as the 2nd Generation pencil had already been released.",
